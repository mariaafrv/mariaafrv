## Hello 🙋🏻‍♀️

My name is Maria Aida, I live in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil and I currently work with iOS Mobile Development.

I confess that neither my first or second contact with programming was with mobile development, however, when I joined a mobile vacancy, I fell in love with creating solutions that fit into people's hands and pockets, and now I'm a Swift enthusiast.

Oh, here's a curiosite about me: when I'm not coding in my free time, I'm fascinated by visiting amazing book stories, I'm certainly a reading freak.

* Age: 22
* Living in: Capão da Canoa - RS, Brazil
* University: I'm currently in my last year of college to get my software analyst degree
